# Howdy! 

My name is Zachary Roman, I am  a behavioral statistician and methodologist at the University of Zurich (UZH),
Switzerland. I am predominately focus on developing novel statistical approaches for behavioral phenomena.
I have several research emphasis, recently I have focused on developing classification models.
Some fields will refer to these approaches as unsupervised learning algorithms.
I work in the development of both dynamic (longitudinal) and cross-sectional approaches.
Another framework I am working on is spatial auto-regressive approaches.
These approaches originated in geography and provide estimates of the permeation of effects in space.
I have recently worked on integrating these approaches with classic models in psychology in an attempt to draw attention to the benefits of
dependence modeling approaches for behavioral research.
